# Standard library imports
import json
import csv
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Third-party imports
import pandas as pd
import pickle
import yaml
# For parquet files, use either:
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
# or
import fastparquet

# It's also good practice to specify versions of critical packages
# you can add this as a comment:
# Required packages:
# pandas>=1.5.0
# PyYAML>=6.0
# pyarrow>=12.0.0 (or fastparquet>=2023.0.0)
