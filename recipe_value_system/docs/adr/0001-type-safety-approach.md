# 1. Type Safety Approach

Date: 2025-03-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Recipe Value System needs a consistent and maintainable approach to type safety that balances correctness with development speed. We need to establish clear patterns for type hints, model definitions, and service interfaces.

## Decision

We will adopt a simplified approach to type safety with the following principles:

1. Core Type System:
   - Use simple string literals for forward references
   - Use basic Python types (List, Optional) instead of custom type aliases
   - Keep SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with mapped_column
   - Remove type: ignore comments by fixing underlying issues
   - Minimize imports to reduce circular dependencies

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Dataclass-based configurations
   - Clear service interfaces
   - Proper datetime handling
   - No Any types
   - Immutable configurations where appropriate

3. Tools and Enforcement:
   - Mypy for static type checking
   - Pre-commit hooks for validation
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Automated testing with type coverage

4. Model Structure:
   - Base models with proper Mapped types
   - Consistent relationship declarations
   - Type-safe service layer
   - Error handling with specific types

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Improved code reliability
- Better IDE support
- Clearer interfaces
- Reduced runtime errors
- Easier maintenance

### Negative:
- Initial development overhead
- Learning curve for new developers
- Some complexity in circular imports
- Need for explicit type declarations

## Implementation Notes

1. Model Layer:
```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column, relationship

class Recipe:
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    title: Mapped[str]
    created_at: Mapped[datetime]
    ingredients: Mapped[List["Ingredient"]] = relationship()
```

2. Service Layer:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class ServiceResult:
    success: bool
    error: Optional[str] = None
```

3. Configuration:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DatabaseConfig:
    url: str
    pool_size: int = 5
```
