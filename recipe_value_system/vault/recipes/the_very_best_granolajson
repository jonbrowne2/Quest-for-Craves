It is absolutely delicious and super easy to make, my family loves it too. I’m just starting to make healthier foods so this was a great recipe to start. I added the fruit in before baking and should have waited until after but it is still delicious. Reply"

      "text": "Bev February 12, 2025 at 2:56 AM Absolutely & utterly the easiest & most scrumptious granola recipe ever. Always keep ingredients in stock – quick to make with added bonus to tweak to your liking…..always extra hazelnuts & cranberries for me. Would NEVER buy another boxed granola. A healthy moorish snack. Friends love it when they receive as a gift. My family & I just love it! ♥️ Reply"

Tasted good though. Maybe increase the maple syrup next time? Not sure. Reply"

      "text": "Gina February 12, 2025 at 6:28 PM Okay, so I’ve made this 4 or 5 times now in the last 2 months. My entire family LOVES it. I’ve looked at other recipes, but this is so simple, why bother when it’s perfect? I’ve played around with different types of oils, nuts, fruit and syrups/honey. All are great, but honestly I think our favorite is exactly how recipe is written. Love the toasty nut flavor and baking at 350 is perfect (others are lower temp) for that. I add some flax meal for additional nutrition, but you don’t even notice it. I may never buy granola again. Thank you for the recipe!!! Reply"

      "text": "Ana February 15, 2025 at 11:30 AM This is so delicious! We have nut allergies in my family so I substituted the pecans with crushed pretzels for the pecans and I used sunflower seeds in lieu of the pepitas. It was a little salty because of the substitutions, so I recommend cutting back on the salt if you do substitute in other ingredients. Still very scrumptious though! Reply"
