I\u2019ve made croissants once, had never heard of a Kouign-Amann until I read about them in the National Day Calendar and decided to try it. The hardest part for me was the butter block, the parchment paper I have wasn\u2019t big enough. But I got it worked out. I put chocolate in some of them, and added cinnamon to the sugar. Delicious, flaky, the ones with chocolate are awesome. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/C7CNd1cPKf7dVD3h/"

They are my favorite pastry (following closely by a morning bun) and hard to find, even in the Washington DC Metro area where I live. Your recipe seems approachable, and I might be brave enough to give it a try. Croissants and their relatives have always seemed to be a bridge too far for this baker, but I think that with your detailed instructions I might be able to do it. Hoping that your son continues to do well. It is always great to read an update about his progress and I\u2019m encouraged for you all about positive results from his treatment."

I first tried another one, for a single large Kouign Amann, and it was a disaster. This recipe was a godsend, because I really wanted individual pastries, and because it\u2019s much better detailed and more logical than the one I tried first. I will say I reduced the amount of sugar, and I used a salted Breton butter, sold at Trader Joe\u2019s under the brand Trader Jacques. In addition, I sprinkled the butter block with about a teaspoon of kosher salt before wrapping it in the yeast dough. The result was actually better than the ones made by my local (very good) French bakery. Although I\u2019ve been baking my whole life (67 years this week), this was my first attempt at any laminated pastry. I\u2019m not sure why I waited so long. I\u2019m starting today on Michelle\u2019s croissant recipe. What\u2019s next? Puff pastry?"

Kouign Amann is known for its sweet, savory taste, which comes from at least 2 tsp of finely ground sea salt being added to 2/3 cup sugar. In fact, in Breton where this pastry hails from it is more savory than sweet. If you omit the salt you are really missing a pastry that is extra special and different from any other pastry you will ever make. Try it!"

I followed it to the letter including removing them 5 minutes after baking so it didn\u2019t stick to the pan and putting them in cupcake liners to cool. It\u2019s incredible and easier than it looks-it really is just something that you do over the course of a day but not difficult. The one time it became harder was when the sugar went in as it made the dough sticker than without so just be mindful of that. Enjoy and thank you BEB!!"

I figure I could cube it and then process until its small pea size, turn it out and then roll it together in the parchment paper? Thanks!"

I did everything as the recipe said, step-by-step with the turns and chilling in between. This is my first time dealing with laminating dough, but I want to try again. What did I do wrong? Thanks! James Bigham \u2014 May 24, 2020 @ 7:23 pm Reply Hey, I know its been months since you posted this comment but I thought I\u2019d reply just in case no one else has! I\u2019d say you weren\u2019t chilling the dough enough between turns. I make a small amount of laminated dough professionally and we chill the dough at least an hour between turns. if you use a quality butter then it will not get to hard to sheet. It acutely makes the dough easier to sheet because it helps the gluten relax. Hope this helps!"

Refrigerating the dough between each turn was a great idea and I didn\u2019t have any problems with the dough getting too soft. I just wanted to say much I appreciate the time and effort you put into researching the recipe and making it fool-proof. We only really see the end result, but it\u2019s obvious you went through many iterations to achieve this product. So thank you!
