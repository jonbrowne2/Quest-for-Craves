  "notes": [
    "INGREDIENT SELECTION: The quality of dried seafood is crucial. Look for large, intact scallops with a sweet aroma and bright orange shrimp without any off smells.",
    "TEMPERATURE CONTROL: Keep heat moderate throughout cooking. Too high heat will burn the ingredients, while too low won't develop proper flavor.",
    "TEXTURE GUIDE: The final texture should be jammy and loose enough to spoon, but not liquid. The oil should separate and float to the top when settled.",
    "AGING: While usable immediately, XO sauce develops deeper flavor over time. Peak flavor is reached after about 2 weeks of aging in the refrigerator.",
    "STORAGE: Properly made and stored (always covered with oil), XO sauce will keep for 6 months in the refrigerator.",
    "USES: Traditional uses include stir-fries, noodles, and congee, but also excellent with pasta, eggs, or grilled meats.",
    "VARIATIONS: Some high-end versions include dried abalone or fish maw. These can be prepared similarly to the scallops if desired."
