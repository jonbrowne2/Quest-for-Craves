  "title": "The WORST Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup unsalted butter (melted and then cooled until no longer warm to the touch (see note))",
    "1 ½ cups light brown sugar (firmly packed)",
    "½ cup granulated sugar",
    "2 large eggs (room temperature preferred)",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "¼ cup maple syrup²",
    "3 ⅓ cups all purpose flour",
    "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "2 cups chocolate chips (I used half regular semisweet chips and half mini semisweet chips)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl, stir together melted butter and sugars.",
    "Add eggs, one at a time, stirring until combined.",
    "Stir in vanilla extract and maple syrup.",
    "In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.",
    "Gradually add flour mixture to wet ingredients, stirring until completely combined.",
    "Stir in chocolate chips.",
    "Cover bowl with clear wrap and allow to chill for at least 30 minutes (chilling!? I told you, this recipe is the worst) and up to 3 days (the cookies look and taste even better after a longer chill. Note the dough will be harder to scoop after a longer chill time, just let it sit at room temperature a bit until it's scoopable)",
    "While the dough is chilling, preheat oven to 350F (175C) and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper (if you don’t have parchment paper, you can bake directly on an ungreased cookie sheet).",
    "Scoop about 2 Tablespoons of cookie dough and roll into balls, making them slightly taller than they are wide. Place them at least 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheet.",
    "Bake about 13 minutes (cookies will appear to be a bit underdone, but edges should be just beginning to turn golden brown).",
    "Allow cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet. If desired, gently press a few chocolate chips on top of the warm cookies.",
    "Keep unbaked cookie dough in fridge while waiting to put the next batch in the oven, and do not place cookie dough on a hot cookie sheet."
