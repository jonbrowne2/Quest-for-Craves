      "text": "Sonya says: February 19, 2024 at 10:37 am Itâ€™s Family Day in Ontario and my son requested French Toast using brioche. Although I have many recipes, I decided to check for any that were brioche specific. Also, I was just at a luxury hotel for work on the weekend and the brioche french toast was really notable, so I was inspired to make something great. I used challah because itâ€™s what I could find and 5% cream because itâ€™s what I had. Also I soaked the bread in the egg mixture at least 5-7 minutes on each side (as some other recipes suggest), but otherwise I followed all the instructions (sometimes I stray!). I didnâ€™t find it time consuming, in fact I appreciated the specific info about how long to cook on each side. The results â€¦.. OUTSTANDING! My son is 21 with an excellent palate & skills and he loved it (he was the one who suggested a much longer soak). Different than any other french toast that I have ever made â€¦ and now the only recipe I will use!! In fact, I already sent it to some friends!!! Reply"

I substituted the brioche bread for Hawaiian sweet bread which is what I had in hand. However my whole family raved it was by far the best homemade French toast theyâ€™ve ever had, and it has now gone into my saved recipes folder. Yum yum!! Reply Abby Bumpus says: April 27, 2024 at 7:58 am This is without a doubt the best French toast Iâ€™ve ever made! Thank you for solving the crusty scrambled egg edge problem, that was always the worst part!! The caramelized sugar was delicious, and I love that they were sturdy enough to be sliced into strips for my toddler instead of being floppy and soggy ðŸ˜… these will definitely be a regular Saturday breakfast for us!

I purchased two loaves of artisan bread, one croissant and the other brioche. I did half and half of each was very happy with the outcome. The egg yolk and sugar trick was the added touches to help from good to amazing. I even ate it cold later in the evening and still crispy and delicious. Reply"

The carmelizing trick could be the 8th Wonder. It was so good I used zero maple syrup and only a few shakes of powered sugar. Thanks for all the tips on freezing and what you can freeze. And how to reheat. I mean, DUH. Thank you. Reply"

It wasnâ€™t a hard process, I did only figure out at the end that adding more butter helps the sugar to caramelize smoother and faster. So, under each slice of french toast i added a little splat of butter and lay the french toast back on top of it and the sugar smoothed out. I was using turbinado cane sugar and it gives it such a rich flavor. And trust me, adding more butter before you try to caramelize The toast will help with getting it to smooth out. Because the crystals are so big, it takes a little longer than regular granulated sugar.
