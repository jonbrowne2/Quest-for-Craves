  "notes": [
    "INGREDIENT QUALITY IS CRUCIAL: The quality of dairy products will make or break this recipe. Use the highest quality butter (European-style with higher butterfat), farm-fresh eggs, premium whole milk, and artisanal cream cheese you can find. The extra cost is worth it.",
    "For overnight rolls: Prepare the rolls (roll out dough, fill them, roll them up, cut them, and put them in the prepared pan, but do not let rise for 1 1/2 hours as stated above) then cover them loosely with plastic and refrigerate for up to 18 hours. When ready to bake, let the rolls sit at room temperature (still covered in plastic) for 30-45 minutes, then bake as directed (they may take slightly longer to bake).",
    "The filling amounts for sugar and cinnamon have been increased by 25% from the original recipe for extra flavor, while keeping the butter amount classic at 4 tablespoons.",
    "The icing recipe has been replaced with an alternative cream cheese icing that's richer and more decadent."
