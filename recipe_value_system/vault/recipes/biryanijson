He said he missed biryani so I followed this recipe on the dot! He liked it! Although, he said it was missing a little bit of aroma. Also, he was looking for the cinnamon bark. Overall, he said this was better than takeaway biryani in our area. Reply"

And then your recipe makes it looks so simple, I must try it! It received the seal of approval from my very picky son and father in law (husband cannot take garam masala, his loss lol). Not to mention the awesome aroma in the whole house which lingers long after dinner is done. Definitely a repeat dish in this family! Reply"

Even with using the spice mixes and recipes that you find in SA. The rice always too wet, not biryani at all. Yours are just dry enough to be authentic with sticking in your throat. Will be a staple in this SA household with your vindaloo curry and flatbread. LOVE your recipes Reply Danica Bornman says April 22, 2024 at 3:28 am Without sticking in your throat Reply"
