  "description": "This isn't just a roast turkey - it's a masterclass in poultry perfection, inspired by Alton Brown's scientific approach. The secret lies in a precise brining process, calculated temperature control, and strategic aromatics placement. The result is a perfectly golden-brown bird with juicy breast meat, properly cooked dark meat, and crispy skin.",

      "text": "RESTING: Remove from oven, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for exactly 30 minutes. During this time, the temperature will rise to 165°F in the breast through carryover cooking."

  "notes": [
    "BRINING SCIENCE: The salt solution alters protein structures, helping the meat retain moisture during cooking. The sugar aids in browning and balances the salt.",
    "TEMPERATURE CONTROL: The initial high heat (500°F) creates a moisture barrier in the skin. The lower temperature (350°F) then allows for even cooking.",
    "TIMING GUIDE: Plan backwards from serving time: 30 minutes rest + 2-2.5 hours roasting + 1 hour tempering + overnight drying + 24-36 hours brining.",
    "DONENESS: The target temperature of 157°F might seem low, but carryover cooking will bring it to the safe temperature of 165°F while keeping the meat juicy.",
    "VARIATIONS: For a smaller turkey (under 14 pounds), reduce cooking time accordingly. For larger turkeys, spatchcock (butterfly) for more even cooking.",
    "LEFTOVERS: Carve all remaining meat off bones within 2 hours. Store meat and bones separately. Bones can be used for stock.",
    "SAFETY: Never stuff a brined turkey with traditional stuffing - the salt content will make it inedible. Use aromatics only."
