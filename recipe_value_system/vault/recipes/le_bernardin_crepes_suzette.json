  "description": "This isn't just Crêpes Suzette - it's a masterclass in French dessert technique, inspired by Eric Ripert's Le Bernardin. The secret lies in the perfect crêpe batter consistency, a 24-hour rest period that develops complex flavors, and a carefully calibrated orange-butter sauce that balances sweet, bitter, and acidic notes. The flambé technique isn't just for show - it adds crucial caramelization and reduces the alcohol to its essence.",

      "text": "ADD FLOUR: With blender running on low speed, gradually add flour. Blend for 30 seconds. Scrape down sides, add orange zest, and blend for another 30 seconds until completely smooth."

      "text": "REST BATTER: Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours. This rest is crucial for tender crêpes."
    },
    {
      "text": "PREPARE FOR COOKING (NEXT DAY): Remove batter from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking. Whisk gently to recombine. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve if needed."
    },
    {
      "text": "COOK CRÊPES: Heat an 8-inch crêpe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brush lightly with melted butter. Pour about 2 tablespoons batter into pan, quickly swirling to coat bottom evenly."
    },
    {
      "text": "COOK AND FLIP: Cook until edges are lightly golden and top is set, about 1 minute. Flip and cook second side for 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter, stacking crêpes between pieces of parchment paper."

      "text": "FOLD AND WARM CRÊPES: Working with 2-3 crêpes at a time, fold each into quarters and add to the simmering sauce. Baste with sauce until heated through."

      "text": "FLAMBÉ: Warm Cognac in a small saucepan. Add to skillet and carefully ignite with a long match. When flames subside, add Grand Marnier and ignite again."

  "notes": [
    "BATTER CONSISTENCY: After resting, the batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If too thick, thin with a little milk.",
    "TEMPERATURE CONTROL: The pan should be hot enough that the batter sizzles gently when added, but not so hot that the butter browns quickly.",
    "CRÊPE TECHNIQUE: The key to perfectly thin crêpes is quick pan rotation immediately after adding the batter.",
    "SAUCE BALANCE: The sauce should have a perfect balance of sweet, bitter (from caramelization), and acidic notes. Adjust orange juice if needed.",
    "FLAMBÉ SAFETY: Have a lid nearby to smother flames if needed. Never pour alcohol directly from the bottle.",
    "TIMING: Crêpes can be made several hours ahead and reheated in the sauce. The sauce should be made just before serving.",
    "SERVING: At Le Bernardin, these are often served with a small scoop of orange-scented vanilla ice cream."
