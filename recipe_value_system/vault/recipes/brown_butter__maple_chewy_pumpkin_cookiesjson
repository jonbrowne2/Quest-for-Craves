    {
      "text": "Have patience â€“ The entire process takes about 10 minutes, but most of the time nothing really happens. The browning takes place at the very end, and it happens very fast. Just keep an eye on the butter and as soon as it starts to foam up, keep stirring until it turns a rich amber color."
    },
    {
      "text": "Donâ€™t take it too far â€“ The brown color will go from light to dark very fast, but you want to land somewhere in the middle. As soon as you start to see the butter turn brown, keep it over the heat for a few more seconds to take it a shade darker. Then, remove from heat and pour into a separate container. Itâ€™s important to pour it out of the hot pot as soon as you can to prevent it from browning any further."
    },
    {
      "text": "Scrape the pot â€“ All the flavor is in the brown bits at the bottom of the pot, so donâ€™t leave those out! When youâ€™re pouring the butter into a measuring glass, make sure you scrape in the little brown specks."
    },
    {
      "text": "Expect less â€“ The amount of butter you start out with is not the same amount you will end with. Expect to have just a bit less than 1 cup of browned butter as some of the liquid evaporates during the browning process."
    },
    {
      "text": "Butter â€“ Using melted butter is a great way to get a more dense cookie. With room temperature butter, air is whipped into the dough during the creaming process. But with melted butter, itâ€™s nearly impossible to build up any air inside the dough."
    },
    {
      "text": "Flour â€“ Itâ€™s important to strike perfect balance of butter and flour. Too much flour and the cookies wonâ€™t spread, too little and the cookies will turn oily and thin. To ensure you use the exact amount needed for these cookies, gently spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level if off with a flat edge. If you scoop directly into the flour container, it pacts it down into the cup which could leave you with 1/4 cup or more of added flour."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maple & Dark Brown Sugar â€“ This is like a one two punch of these chewy cookies. These two add so much flavor to these cookies, while also building a strong and chewy texture. Dark brown sugar contains a higher amount of molasses than light brown sugar, so it builds a much more dense cookie. Paired with the maple syrup, the two help weigh down the cookie to stop it from puffing up."

      "text": "Pour the butter into a measuring glass to ensure you have the right amount, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to get all of the brown bits as well. It should be a bit short of 1 cup. Place in the refrigerator to chill for about 20 minutes. Donâ€™t let it solidify."

      "text": "Dionakaye says: December 13, 2024 at 12:49 am Hi Jenna! I coated my first try of these cookies with dark brown sugar since the recipe outline did not indicate otherwise, and you used dark brown sugar in the core cookie recipe. Also, I wished I had thought to sprinkle flaky sea salt on top of the cookies prior to baking, since it looks like you did so with yours. My cookies look darker than yours, but all in all, taste so buttery and good. Thank you for this recipe!! Reply"

Iâ€™ve been making these the last two holidays and they are hands down the best cookie. Everyone LOVES them. Iâ€™m making 3 batches this year. Last year I made several different cookies for people, but these were the favorite so Iâ€™m just making these this year. They are amazing, fairly easy and I will make these forever! Reply"

      "text": "Cookie Bear says: November 27, 2024 at 12:17 pm Love the recipe. Making the cookies this large really helps them stay chewy. I was going to bake smaller ones but figured they would be dry rocks. A tip for keeping them moist and chewy in the sealed storage container is to add a slice of commercial sandwich bread to the container. It has moisture in it that will keep the cookies soft like they were just baked. Thanks for posting. PS, I added 1 tsp molasses thinned with rum extract and used maple sugar and maple syrup to make up the 3 tbsp of liquid. This punched up the maple, molasses and extract flavors against the spices. I still added the vanilla too. Reply"
