  "status": "legendary",
  "yields": "6 servings",
  "description": "This isn't just a curry - it's a masterclass in South Indian beef preparation. Popular in Kerala, particularly in Syrian Christian households, this dish transforms tough beef into tender, caramelized morsels through slow cooking and careful spicing. The secret lies in the three-stage cooking process: initial pressure cooking with aromatics, slow reduction with ground spices, and final high-heat tempering with curry leaves and coconut.",

  "notes": [
    "MEAT SELECTION: Choose beef chuck with good marbling. Some traditional versions use beef shank or cheek for extra texture.",
    "SPICE BALANCE: The dish should be deeply spiced but not overwhelmingly hot. Kashmiri chilies provide color without excessive heat.",
    "COCONUT OIL: Traditional Kerala preparation demands coconut oil for its distinct flavor. Don't substitute if possible.",
    "SERVING: Traditionally served with Kerala parotta, appam, or steamed rice. Some prefer it as a bar snack with drinks.",
    "TIMING: While delicious immediately, this dish improves overnight as flavors meld. Consider making it a day ahead.",
    "VARIATIONS: Some versions include a splash of vinegar or kudampuli (kokum) for sourness. Others finish with a dash of brandy for depth.",
    "STORAGE: Keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. The flavors actually improve with time."
